</div>

<p>If Mr.&nbsp;Cabell had not pre-empted the phrase,
the words with which he characterized the tale
<cite>Jurgen</cite> might well be used as a title for an account
of the tale’s adventures with the law.
Those adventures, which the matter of this book
commemorates no less effectively than it helped to
divert them from a less happy outcome, form indeed
a comedy of justice: a comedy which, perhaps,
aroused more of indignation than of mirth,
and which, in its duration, somewhat exceeded the
time-limit that a canny dramatist allots himself,
but which ended appropriately on a note of justice,
and thus showed Mr.&nbsp;Cabell to be not only
the maker of a happily descriptive phrase but also
somewhat of a prophet.</p>

<p>Well, the comedy of <cite>Jurgen’s</cite> suppression is
ended. The book is admitted once more to the
freedom of the library, and the pawnbroker is
again at liberty to wander throughout the universe
in search of rationality and fair dealing.
And in due course, time and the wisdom of other
generations will decide whether the pawnbroker,
or the book, or the adventures of either be in any
way memorable.</p>

<p>Today, however, the vicissitudes of <cite>Jurgen</cite>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
are of indisputable importance, if only because
similar misfortunes may overtake yet other publications.
At the moment it appears that the position
of literature is less precarious than it has
been in the recent past. For the courts, of late,
with gratifying accord have failed to detect obscenity
in a number of volumes at which professional
righteousness has taken offense, and there
apparently is cause to hope that legal precedent
will dispel the obscurity which so long has surrounded
decency—within the meaning of the
statute. Yet it is still possible for an incorporated
organization to waylay and imprison art:
to exercise by accusation a censorship which impermanence
makes no less dangerous. Until the
difference between the liberty permitted to art
and the license forbidden to the vulgar be clearly
defined, it remains impossible for any artist to
foreknow how fully he may describe and thereby
interpret life as he sees it, or for the community
to enjoy uninterrupted access to much of the best
of ancient and modern literature.</p>

<p>In the pages which follow is printed an argument
that expressly defines the test whereby that
which is legally permissible and that which is prohibited
may be determined. It is, explicitly, an
argument in behalf of <cite>Jurgen</cite>, submitted at the
trial of the publishers of that book: and it is
published in book form, in part because of its
intrinsic interest to all readers of Cabell, in part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
because it is a valuable addition to the literature
of censorship. But here there seems need to
preface the argument with a brief history of the
<cite>Jurgen</cite> case.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It is now a trifle less than three years ago that
a Mr.&nbsp;Walter J. Kingsley, a theatrical press agent,
sent to the literary editor of a New York newspaper a
letter<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href='#Footnote_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
directing attention to James
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Branch Cabell’s <cite>Jurgen</cite> as a source of lewd pleasure
to the sophisticated and of menace to the
moral welfare of Broadway. Hitherto <cite>Jurgen</cite>
had found some favor with a few thousands of
discriminating readers; it had been advertised—with,
its publishers must now admit, a disregard
of the value of all pornographic appeal—as literature.
Critics, with varying degrees of enthusiasm,
had applauded the book as a distinguished
addition to American letters; three editions had
been printed and the tale promised to enjoy the
success to which its wit, its beauty and the profundity
of its theme entitled it. No one, until
Mr.&nbsp;Kingsley broke silence, had complained of
<cite>Jurgen</cite> as an obscene production; no letters of
condemnation had been received by the publishers;
and the press had failed to suggest that
decorum, much less decency, had anywhere been
violated.</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Kingsley’s letter altered affairs. Immediately
a chorus in discussion of <cite>Jurgen</cite> arose.
In the newspapers appeared many letters, some
in defense of the book, others crying Amen to
Mr.&nbsp;Kingsley. Within a week, the merry game
of discovering the “key” to <cite>Jurgen</cite> was well under
way and a pleasant, rather heated controversy
had begun. In the upshot some one sent a clipping
of the Kingsley letter to Mr.&nbsp;John S. Sumner,
secretary of the New York Society for the
Suppression of Vice, calling upon him to do his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
duty. Mr.&nbsp;Sumner procured a copy of the book,
and, on January 14th, 1920, armed with a warrant,
he entered the offices of the publishers, seized the
plates and all copies of the book and summoned
the publishers to appear in court the following
day on a charge of violating section 1141 of the
Penal
code.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href='#Footnote_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a></p>

<p>Thereafter the record is uneventful. Mr.&nbsp;Sumner’s
complaint<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href='#Footnote_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
was duly presented and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
case was called for formal hearing in the magistrate’s
court on January 23. Upon that date the
defendants waived examination and the case was
committed for trial in the Court of Special Sessions.
The trial was set for March 8, but upon
motion of Mr.&nbsp;John Quinn, then Counsel for the
Defense, who appeared before Justice Malone, the
case was submitted for consideration to the Grand
Jury which found an indictment against the
publishers<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href='#Footnote_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
thereby transferring the case to the Court
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
of General Sessions and enabling the defendants
to secure a trial by jury. On May 17, 1920, the
publishers pleaded not guilty ... and, until October
16, 1922, awaited trial.</p>

<p>For, in New York, a “crime wave” was in progress.
The courts were crowded with cases which
involved other than a possible technical violation
of the laws; and, however anxious to rid the
docket of the <cite>Jurgen</cite> case, neither the courts nor
the District Attorney’s office could do other than
give precedence to the trials of persons charged
with more serious offenses.</p>

<p>On October 16, then, two and one half years
after the indictment, the <cite>Jurgen</cite> case was called
before Judge Charles C. Nott in the Court of General
Sessions. A jury was drawn, the book was
submitted in evidence and the people’s case was
presented. The defendants, through their attorneys,
Messrs. Goodbody, Danforth and Glenn,
and their counsel, Mr.&nbsp;Garrard Glenn, moved for
the direction of a verdict of acquittal, submitting,
in behalf of their motion, the brief which is
printed hereinafter. The trial was adjourned for
three days; and on October 19, 1922, Judge Nott
rendered his decision, which also appears hereinafter,
and directed the jury to bring in a verdict
of acquittal.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>There ends the record of the tale <cite>Jurgen’s</cite> adventures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
with the law. The record is, as has been
said, uneventful. A book had been impugned,
that is all. An author had been vilified and his
publishers indicted; certain thousands of readers
had been deprived of access to a book which
critical opinion had commended to their interest;
and author and publishers both had been robbed
of the revenues from whatever sale the book
might have had during the nearly three years in
which it was removed from publication.</p>

<p>True, Mr.&nbsp;Cabell and his book had received
much publicity.... There is a legend, indeed,
that the author of <cite>Jurgen</cite> (and of a dozen other
distinguished books) owes much of his present
place in letters to the advertising which Mr.&nbsp;Sumner
involuntarily accorded him. But one may
question that. An examination of the publishers’
files seem to show that most of the expressions of
admiration for <cite>Jurgen</cite> were repetitions of an enthusiasm
expressed before the book’s “suppression.”
And if the enthusiasm and the sympathy
of Mr.&nbsp;Cabell’s admirers were hearteningly evident,
the attacks of his detractors did not flag;
and an inestimable number of persons, knowing
Mr.&nbsp;Cabell’s work only through the recorded opinions
of Messrs. Kingsley and Sumner, did certainly
condemn him unread and, shuddering,
barred their library doors against him.... No,
Mr.&nbsp;Cabell owes no debt of thanks to the accusers
of <cite>Jurgen</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
But all this is by the way. The argument,
which appears in the following pages, is of
importance not alone because it so ably defends
<cite>Jurgen</cite>, but because it defines, more clearly than
any other recent document, the present legal
status of literature in America in relation to permissible
candor in treatment and subject matter.
The brief is not in any sense an argument in behalf
of unrestricted publication of any matter,
however obscene, or indeed in behalf of the publication
of obscenity in any form. It is not a
denial of the community’s right to protect itself
from offenses against good taste or against its
moral security, or to punish violation of the laws
by which the public welfare is safe-guarded.</p>

<p>But one need not be an apologist of license to
perceive that there is in a thoughtful consideration
of every aspect of life no kinship to indecency;
or to perceive that the community cannot,
without serious danger to its own cultural development,
ignore the distinction between the artist’s
attempt to create beauty by means of the written
word, and the lewd and vulgar outpourings of
the pornographer. When these two things are
confused by a semi-official organization which is
endowed with suppressive powers, even when the
courts fail to sustain its accusations, the menace
to the community is measurably increased. As a
protection against this menace the brief presents,
with admirable clarity, a legal test, the validity of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
which common sense will readily recognize, for the
determination of literature as distinct from
obscenity.</p>

Acquittal.</em></span></p>

<p>The defendants have moved for a directed acquittal
at the close of the People’s case. The defendants
did not dispute upon the trial the facts
which went to make up such case as the People
had. That case is that the defendants had in their
possession, with intent to sell (they are publishers)
a book, “Jurgen”, by Mr.&nbsp;James Branch Cabell; and
it is contended that the book is lewd and obscene
within Section 1141 of the Penal Law.</p>

<em>1—The Question presented is one of law,
which the Court should decide.</em></h2>
</div>


<p class='b0'>The rule here to be applied is that obtaining
in all criminal cases. It is the Court’s duty to
direct an acquittal when the People’s case has
failed to show guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class='cases'><cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Gluck</cite> (188 N. Y. 167);</p>
<p class='cases'><cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Smith</cite> (84 Misc. 348);</p>
<p class='cases'><cite>Babcock</cite> v. <cite>People</cite> (15 Hun 347).</p>

<p>The indictment is for having in possession with
intent to sell, a book offending against Section 1141
of the Penal Law. Since the defendants do not dispute
the fact that they did have in their possession
the book with intent to sell it, the simple question
is whether this book violates the criminal law of this
state as expressed in the section of the Penal Law
above noted.</p>

<p class='b0'>While it is sometimes said that this question is
one of fact, upon which it is the function of a jury
to pass, nevertheless it is clear that, when the defendant
raises the question whether the book, as
a matter of law, violates the statute, that question
is one of law upon which it is the duty of the court
to pass.</p>

<p class='cases'><cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Brainard</cite> (192 App. Div. 816);</p>
<p class='cases'><cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>New York Society</cite> (234 N. Y. 1).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is true that whether the book offends
against this statute is ordinarily a question of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
fact for the jury in the first place to determine.
It is equally true that upon the review
of a conviction for having offended against this
provision, it is the duty of this court to examine
the publication and see whether the conviction
can be sustained under the facts proven.
Upon an examination of the book I am satisfied
that neither defendant has been guilty of the
offense charged in the information, and for this
reason the judgment and conviction of the
defendant corporation, as well as the defendant
Brainard, should be reversed and the information
dismissed.” (<cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Brainard</cite>, 192

question? Those tests, like all the others which the
courts have used in the application of criminal law
to the case of the individual against whom it is
alleged that his act has offended the interests of
society, are simple and do not go beyond the actual
necessities. Courts in this respect have not forgotten
the lessons of history; and of these lessons
one which Macaulay’s school boy knows is that
under our common law dispensation there has not
been, since the abolition of the Courts of Star
Chamber and of High Commission, nor will
there ever be again, such a spirit in our law as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
may result, through statute or decision, in the
institution of a censorship of the mind in its
modes of expression. To use the words of Seabury,
<em>J.</em>, “it is no part of the duty of courts to
exercise a censorship over literary productions”
(<cite>St. Hubert Guild</cite> v. <cite>Quinn</cite>, 64 Misc. 336, 340). And
it is in that spirit that common law courts have approached
any case such as this from the days when
the obscene became cognizable by common law
courts in the exercise of a jurisdiction which they
took over from the Courts Spiritual. (<cite>Rex</cite> v. <cite>Curl</cite>,
17 How. St. Trials, 153.) It is true that, for a
time, during the intellectual ferment in the early
part of the Nineteenth Century, the courts, under
the inspiration of Lord Eldon <em>did</em> revert to an idea
of censorship closely resembling that which Laud
advocated in the days of Courts of High Commission;
but contemporary opinion of the best minds
of the bar, as well as of the public, revolted against
this attitude, and the rule thus suggested never became
a part of our law.</p>

<p>Seabury, <em>J.</em>, has well traced this as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The early attitude of the courts upon this
subject discloses an illiberality of opinion
which is not reflected in the recent cases. Perhaps
no one was more responsible for this early
position than Lord Eldon, who refused to protect
by injunction Southey’s “Wat Tyler” until
the innocent character of the work was proved.
<cite>Southey</cite> v. <cite>Sherwood</cite>, 2 Meriv. 437. He assumed
a like position in reference to Byron’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Cain (6 Petersdorff Abr. 558, 559), and expressed
a doubt (which he hoped was reasonable)
as to the innocent character of Milton’s
“Paradise Lost”. “When Dr. Johnson heard of
some earlier opinions to the same effect, he is
reported to have said: ‘They make me think of
your judges, not with that respect which I
should wish to do.’ Judging from the fact that
a jury held the publication of Shelley’s ‘Queen
Mab’ to be an indictable offense (Moxon’s Case,
2 Mod. St. Tr. 356), it seems that jurors were
no more liberal than judges in these matters.
In commenting upon some of Lord Eldon’s
judgments on the subject of literary property,
Lord Campbell remarked that ‘it must have
been a strange occupation for a judge who for
many years had meddled with nothing more
imaginative than an Act of Parliament to determine
in what sense the speculations of
Adam, Eve, Cain, and Lucifer are to be understood.’
10 Campbell’s Lives of the Lord Chancellors,
257.” (<cite>St. Hubert Guild</cite> v. <cite>Quinn</cite>, 64
Misc. 336, 339, 340.)</p>
</div>

<p>But the spirit of censorship, thus for a time
strangely revived, soon passed. Today therefore
the courts apply simple tests, tests savoring of
nothing that involves censorship, tests necessary
only for the protection of the public against
influences that directly, and without the necessity
of argument in demonstrating their effect,
bear upon public morals. It requires, therefore,
but a few words to describe these tests as they
are known to the law of this state today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>
<p>In the first place, the words of the statute mean
exactly what they say and require no subtlety of interpretation.
In the words of Cullen, <em>C. J.</em>, the statute
“is directed against lewd, lascivious and salacious
or obscene publications, the tendency of which
is to excite lustful and lecherous desire.” (<cite>People</cite>
v. <cite>Eastman</cite>, 188 N. Y. 478, 480.) That being true,
this simple test excludes others which, however
subtle may be the argument in their support, however
honest the intention of the people who urge
them, inevitably lead to the thing which Seabury,
<em>J.</em>, has said,—but which everybody would know
even if it had not been said by this particular
Judge,—is outside the purview of criminal law as
administered in English-speaking countries,—censorship
by indictment.</p>

<p>In the second place this statute does not forbid
publication of the polemical. “It seems to be”,
says Andrews, <em>J.</em>, of the book under review by the
Court of Appeals, “largely a protest against what
the author, we believe mistakenly, regards as the
prudery of newspaper criticism.” (<cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>New
York Society</cite>, 234 N. Y. 1, 4.) The prosecutor, and
indeed the court itself, may not agree with what
the book may advocate, may not take the sentiment
which it expresses, but the book cannot be condemned
for that. “Differ as men may as to the
views of Voltaire on many questions”, said Seabury,
<em>J.</em>, in the case which we have already cited, “his
works cannot be burned by the public hangman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
under the guise of a section of our Penal Code.”
(<cite>St. Hubert’s Guild</cite> v. <cite>Quinn</cite>, 64 Misc. 336, 342.)
We need not, however, pursue this subject further,
because <cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Eastman</cite> (188 N. Y. 478) stands
as a monument to the proposition under discussion.
One has only to read the article for which an indictment
was brought (it is repeated verbatim in the
dissenting opinion of O’Brien, <em>J.</em>, at pp. 482–484)
to realize that its nature was such as to excite in
the minds of thousands of our best citizens feelings
which it is impossible adequately to describe. Yet,
disregarding the decision of the English courts in
<cite>Regina</cite> v. <cite>Hicklin</cite> (L. B. 3 Q. B. 369), where a
precisely similar book was held indictable, our
Court of Appeals sustained a demurrer to an indictment
which set forth the article in question.</p>

<p class='b0'>Nor is it necessary, in order to protect a book
from indictment, that it teach a moral lesson.</p>

<p class='cases'><cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Brainard</cite> (192 App. Div. 816);</p>
<p class='cases'><cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>N. Y. Society</cite> (234 N. Y. 1).</p>

<p>The Appellate Division of this Department has
well borne out this proposition when, in reversing
a judgment of conviction, it said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can see no useful purpose in the publication
of the book. I cannot agree that it has
any moral lesson to teach. Its publication
might well be prohibited as a recital of life
in the underworld, as is prohibited books containing
recitals of crimes.” (<cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Brainard</cite>,
192 App. Div. 816, 821.)</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>
<p>In short, this statute was not intended, as the
Court of Appeals has said in one of the cases above
cited, “to regulate manners”. (<cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Eastman</cite>,
188 N. Y. 478, 480.)</p>

<p>What then do these tests of the law come to?
The courts in their own words have told us that. If
the book has literary merit, then it is not within
the condemnation of the statute.</p>

<p>O’Brien, <em>J.</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is very difficult to see upon what theory
these world-renowned classics can be regarded
as specimens of that pornographic literature
which it is the office of the Society for the Suppression
of Vice to suppress, or how they can
come under any stronger condemnation than
that high standard literature which consists of
the works of Shakespeare, of Chaucer, of Laurence
Sterne, and of other great English writers,
without making reference to many parts
of the Old Testament Scriptures, which are to
be found in almost every household in the land.
The very artistic character, the high qualities
of style, the absence of those glaring and crude
pictures, scenes, and descriptions which affect
the common and vulgar mind, make a place for
books of the character in question, entirely
apart from such gross and obscene writings as
it is the duty of the public authorities to suppress.
It would be quite as unjustifiable to
condemn the writings of Shakespeare and
Chaucer and Laurence Sterne, the early English
Novelists, the playwrights of the Restoration,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and the dramatic literature which has so
much enriched the English language, as to
place an interdict upon these volumes, which
have received the admiration of literary men
for so many years.” (<cite>Re Worthington Co.</cite>, 30
N. Y. Supp. 361, 362; 24 L. R. A. 110.)</p>
</div>

<p>Andrews, <em>J.</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With the author’s felicitous style, it contains
passages of purity and beauty * * *
Here is the work of a great author, written in
admirable style, which has become a part of
classical literature.” (<cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>N. Y.
Society</cite>, 234 N. Y. 1, 4, 6.)</p>
</div>

<p>Seabury, <em>J.</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Offensive as some of the phrases of this
book undoubtedly are to the taste of our day,
yet I do not think we can declare a contract
for its sale illegal on this account.” (<cite>St.
Hubert Guild</cite> v. <cite>Quinn</cite>, 64 Misc. 336, 338.)</p>
</div>

<p>Literature, to use the phrase of Matthew Arnold,
is nothing more nor less than a criticism of life, of
the relation of man to the universe and to his fellow
man. When any phase of that subject is discussed,
then you have literature, though you may
not agree with the point of view which the author
advocates. Thus, in one of the cases from which
we have already frequently cited, Seabury, <em>J.</em>,
points out the violent differences of opinion that
arose and still exist, regarding Voltaire’s “Maid
of Orleans”:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Frederick the Great admired it and paid it
the doubtful compliment of imitation, and Condorcet
regarded it only as an attack upon
hypocrisy and superstition. Less prejudiced
critics than these condemn it with severity, and
even admirers of Voltaire regret that there are
passages in it which have dimmed the fame of
its author.” (<cite>St. Hubert Guild</cite> v. <cite>Quinn</cite>, 64
Misc. 336, 338.)</p>
</div>

<p>For that very reason the final test of the law, as
recognized by the courts of this State, is simple. It
is only whether the thing is literature as distinct
from a simple effort to portray the obscene.</p>

<p>It is quite true that scattered here and there
in the books, are to be found expressions to the
effect that a thing may be literature and yet be
within the statute. The argument is that there are
two classes in the community, the intelligent and
the ignorant. Something may be literature and the
intelligent will so appreciate it, but the statute
is to protect the other class—the ones who
ought not to be entrusted with books at all. The
<i lang='la'>sequitur</i> is that a book is unlawful unless it can
be read by the ignorant, by the child incapable of
appreciating the sustained thought. To this effect
will one find expressions in <cite>U. S.</cite> v. <cite>Clark</cite> (38 Fed.
734), and the General Term decision in <cite>People</cite> v.
<cite>Muller</cite> (32 Hun, 209). But one will never find
that the Court of Appeals of this state has spoken
to that effect, or has made that classification. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
did not do so in affirming the judgment in <cite>People</cite>
v. <cite>Muller</cite> (96 N. Y. 408), which, by the way, dealt
with a picture and not a book; and it certainly did
not do so when it expressed itself in <cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Eastman</cite>
(188 N. Y. 478) or in <cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>N. Y. Society</cite>
(234 N. Y. 1). In <cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Eastman</cite>, as we have
said, the article was undoubtedly such as should
not fall into the hands of a child; and in <cite>Halsey</cite>
v. <cite>N. Y. Society</cite> the majority opinion frankly admits
that there are paragraphs in the book which,
standing alone, are undoubtedly indecent. Nor
has the successor of the General Term, the
Appellate Division, spoken to that effect. Its
decision in <cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Brainard</cite> (192 App.
Div. 816) certainly does not bear out such
interpretation. Nor have judges, sitting at Special
or Trial Term, or in the Appellate Term, so expressed
themselves. O’Brien, <em>J.</em>, certainly made no
such distinction in <cite>Matter of Worthington</cite> (30
N. Y. Supp. 363; 24 L. R. A. 110). Nor did Seabury,
<em>J.</em>, make any such distinction in <cite>St. Hubert
Guild</cite> v. <cite>Quinn</cite> (64 Misc. 336). If that were the
law of this state, we say, with all sincerity, that
literature would have to be reduced to the level
of the movies; the stage would be reduced to the
rendition of charades, thousands of plays being
barred, ranging from those of which Shakespeare
was the craftsman, to the productions of Somerset
Maugham; Swinburne’s Chorus in “Atalanta in
Calydon” would be on the index, and Keats would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
be barred from any public library because of “Endymion”
and “The Eve of St. Agnes”. Nay, Sir
Walter Scott’s collection of border minstrelsy
would be barred because it contains those two
exquisite ballads, “The Eve of St. John” and “Clerk
Saunders and May Margaret”; and, incidentally,
the “Oxford Book of English Verse” should be
burned because it contains reprints of all these
things. But it is useless to pursue this subject,
for, to use the favorite phrase of the late Chief
Justice White, “to state the argument is to answer
it”. No, the test is whether the thing is literary;
whether it is a criticism of life; whether that effort
is apparent in the book.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ch_3"><em>3—In applying this test, all reasonable doubt
should be resolved in favor of the book.</em></h2>
</div>

<p>The courts, to repeat, apply the simple test of
literature as distinct from the mere portrayal of
the obscene. And in getting at whether a thing is
literature, they are not disposed to substitute their
judgment for that of others who speak of the book
in the spirit of sincerity; nor are they disposed to
tip the scales, even if people of that sort differ
in their conclusions. “We have quoted”, says
Andrews, <em>J.</em>, in the latest case, “estimates of the
book as showing the manner in which it affects
different minds. The conflict among the members
of this court itself points a finger at the dangers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
of a censorship entrusted to men of one profession,
of like education and similar surroundings.”
(<cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>N. Y. Society</cite>, 234 N. Y. 1, 6.)
Likewise, the opinions in <cite>St. Hubert’s Guild</cite> v.
<cite>Quinn</cite> (64 Misc. 336), and <cite>Matter of Worthington</cite>
(30 N. Y. Supp. 363; 24 L. R. A. 110) refer to
various criticisms of the books involved, as do the
opinions of Magistrate Simpson and Magistrate
Oberwager in the very recent (and still unreported)
cases of <cite>People</cite> v. <cite>Seltzer</cite> and <cite>People</cite> v.
<cite>Salsberg and Boni &amp; Liveright</cite>. In all of those
cases the criticisms were contained in book or magazine
form, which were available to the Court. In
the present case the various criticisms of the book
here involved are not available in such form, and
consequently we are submitting herewith copies of
letters and newspaper clippings containing the
opinions of many competent critics concerning that
book, which we respectfully ask this Court to consider
in rendering its decision upon this motion.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ch_4"><em>4—In judging the book by the standards
above indicated, it must be read as a whole,
and, on that basis, it must be upheld even
though it may contain portions which would

</div>


<p class='b0'>From what has already been said another conclusion
follows:—The book is to be judged not by
isolated passages in it, but by the whole book.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
Peculiarly is this true in the present case, where
the book at large is indicted, not parts of it, as
was the case when complaint was made in
Special Sessions, but all of it without reference
to any particular part. That, when a book is
indicted as a whole, no judgment can be passed
upon it which is not based upon a reading of the
whole, with the necessary test of correlation which
this entails, would seem manifest on its face. But
in view of certain expressions which judicially fell
in the federal case of <cite>U. S.</cite> v. <cite>Bennett</cite> (16 Blatchf.
338; Fed. Cs. No. 14,571), it is just as well to refer
to the fact that, both in England and in this State,
the test is the whole book, not isolated parts to
which it may please the prosecutor to point an accusing
finger.</p>

<p class='cases'><cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>N. Y. Society</cite> (234 N. Y. 1);</p>

<p class='cases'><cite>St. Hubert’s Guild</cite> v. <cite>Quinn</cite> (64 Misc. 336).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class='b0'>“The judgment of the court below is based
upon a few passages in each of these works,
and these passages have been held to be of
such a character as to invalidate the contract
upon which the action has been brought.
These few passages furnish no criterion by
which the legality of the consideration of the
contract can be determined. That some of
these passages, judged by the standard of our
day, mar rather than enhance the value of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
books can be admitted without condemning the
contract for the sale of the books as illegal.
The same criticism has been directed against
many of the classics of antiquity and against
the works of some of our greatest writers from
Chaucer to Walt Whitman, without being regarded
as sufficient to invalidate contracts for
the sale or publication of their works.”</p>
</div>

<p class='cases'><cite>St. Hubert Guild</cite> v. <cite>Quinn</cite> (64 Misc. 336, 339).</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p class='b0'>“No work may be judged from a selection of
such paragraphs alone. Printed by themselves
they might, as a matter of law, come within
the prohibition of the statute. So might a
similar selection from Aristophanes or Chaucer
or Boccaccio or even from the Bible. The
book, however, must be considered broadly as
a whole.”</p>
</div>

<p class='cases'><cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>N. Y. Society</cite> (234 N. Y. 1, 4).</p>

<p>The proposition thus laid down is nothing but
common sense,—the common sense which was expressed,
over a century ago, in a trial in the Irish
King’s Bench, for the publication of an alleged
libel:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr.&nbsp;Burrowes.—My lords, I beg to know,
whether the Court be of opinion, that without
any averment respecting other passages in the
book, the counsel for the crown are entitled to
read them.</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Justice Day.—In order to show the <i lang='la'>quo
animo</i>, they may read those other passages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Justice Osborne.—I think they have such
right, as evidence of the intention.</p>

<p>Lord Chief Justice Downes.—And the defendant,
if he thinks fit, may read all the rest
of the book.” (<cite>Fitzpatrick’s Case</cite>, 31 Hows.
St. Tr. 1170, 1186.)</p>
</div>

<p>It follows that if the book must be taken as a
whole, then it cannot be condemned piecemeal. No
part can be read without a mind to its relation to
the whole. In the latest case on the subject,
Andrews <em>J.</em>, speaking for the majority of the court,
twice concedes that, taken by themselves, certain
parts of the book are not to be justified:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It contains many paragraphs, however,
which taken by themselves are undoubtedly
vulgar and indecent. * * * On the other
hand, it <em>does</em> contain indecent paragraphs.”
<cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>N. Y. Society</cite> (234 N. Y. 1, 4, 6).</p>
</div>

<p>Yet the book was upheld for all that, both because,
in the words which the court adopted from the late
Professor Wells of Sewanee, the author there involved
“helps us over the instinctive repulsion that
we feel for the situation”, and because he excites
“a purely artistic interest”, etc. (<cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>N. Y.
Society</cite>, 234 N. Y. 1, 5.)</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ch_5"><em>5—The book, read as a whole, sustains the
test of the law.</em></h2>
</div>


<p>The following has been prepared by counsel,
with full appreciation of the fact that the book under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
review must, in the last analysis, speak for itself,
and that every book makes its different impression
on each mind that it reaches. The only possible
aid to reflection which this writing can constitute
therefore, lies in such suggestion as it fairly may
convey, that Mr.&nbsp;Cabell’s book is literature, in the
accepted sense of that term, which is, as the foregoing
brief shows, the legal sense as well. It presents
a theme and its object is to stimulate reflection.</p>

<p>The book in question is a criticism of life. It
treats with satire certain of the thoughts so current
among us. It is Matthew Arnold and Carlyle
in different guise. But the guise adopted is not
new or novel. In the Sixteenth Century Erasmus
put forth his comments on the ruling ideas of his
time by writing a book “In Praise of Folly”. Mr.&nbsp;Cabell
has adopted the same method of treatment.
To his book can be applied the words which
Professor Wells spoke of a book which our Court
of Appeals has recently held <em>not</em> to be within the
condemnation of the statute invoked in the present
case: “With a springboard of fact in the seventeenth
century to start from, he * * * transfers
the adventures from the real world to a sort of
forest of Arden, where the Rosalind of Shakespeare
might meet a Watteau shepherdess and a melancholy
Jacques.” (<cite>Halsey</cite> v. <cite>N. Y. Society</cite>, 234
N. Y. 1, 5.)</p>

<p>But that is not the only motive of the book. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
deals also with aspirations for the unattainable,
aspirations which it falls to the lot of some men
to feel,—aspirations whose portrayal finds expression
in books ranging from Goethe’s “Faust” to
Sinclair Lewis’s “Babbitt”. These are things
which, to use the words of Magistrate Simpson in
the recent (and still unreported) case of <cite>People</cite> v.
<cite>Seltzer</cite>, are not “naturally calculated to excite in
the susceptible impure imaginations”. And if we
want a moral lesson, we have it, because these desires
are shown to be useless. <em>The conventional
cannot be escaped by fleeing to sin, for wickedness
itself is conventional.</em></p>

<p>And may we observe in passing that the author,
Mr.&nbsp;Cabell, is no radical? He makes no plea for
reform by way of sociological experiment. Indeed,
as expressed in “Beyond Life”, his contempt for
sociology has been condemned by one of the apostles
of the new Reign of Science and a lecturer
in the Rand School (Robinson, “The Mind in the
Making”, page 208). “What we want”, said Mr.&nbsp;Gradgrind,
“are facts”. Mr.&nbsp;Cabell’s book now
under attack deals with things not within the spectrum
of the Gradgrind School,—eternal things
which continue whether the world happens to be of
the “New Philosophy” mode of thinking, or to have
returned to the Age of Faith. How well he succeeds
with what he has undertaken is quite another
matter; in law it is sufficient that he has assumed
the task. And with this in mind, the following
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
undertakes to tell what one reader, at least, may
think that “<cite>Jurgen</cite>” is about.</p>

<p>Jurgen’s name is “derived from jargon, a confused
chattering such as birds give forth at sunrise”
(183).<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href='#Footnote_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
He is a pawnbroker, and he lives
in Poictesme, but it might just as well be Kennaquhair.
In his youth he had been in love with
a Lady Dorothy; at forty-four we find him a
pawnbroker, settled down to business, with a wife
who has all the virtues of the good wife; somewhat
henpecked, longing, like Sinclair Lewis’ Babbitt,
for he knows not what. He has not the culture of
Faust, he is not a Ph.D.; but, like the doctor of
Leipzig whose venturings as set forth in legend
attracted Marlowe and then Goethe, Jurgen yearns
for “the distant land”, where he shall be able “to
grasp infinite nature”. He thinks that he is a
“monstrous clever fellow”;—so did Faust, the
learned doctor,—in the end he reaches his salvation
through a return to the routine from whence he
came. Like Faust he assumes to unravel a tangled
knot. Life is a riddle, nature is a mystery, justice
has an indefinable basis. The learned man in
Goethe’s poem seeks to find out why these things
are so; Mr.&nbsp;Cabell’s hero is a man of ordinary station,
but he, too, pursues the quest.</p>

<p>Jurgen passes from his routine of life, as Faust
does, through communion with spirits that partake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
of the power of darkness. It all starts with one
night when, on his way home from a day of trafficking
in his shop, Jurgen passes a Cistercian
monk who, having stumbled over a stone, is
cursing the devil that had placed it there. “Fie,
brother”, says this wordly wise, this all sufficient
Jurgen, “have not the devils enough to bear as it
is?” (1) This attracts the attention of an earth
spirit, one Koshchei, “who made things as they
are”.</p>

<p>For that reason this spirit, Koshchei, has his
limitations. To him love is impossible—not carnal
love, but the love of God, such love as never enters
into Hell (257); such love as Jurgen’s grandmother,
instructed by the priest, has for God (299,
302). Also to this earth spirit, Koshchei, is pride
impossible (303). Of heavenly love the earth spirit
cannot conceive, because he “made things as they
are, and day and night he contemplates things as
they are”. “How then”, says God Himself, “can
Koshchei love anything?” (303). Pride, as the
philosophical Satan tells Jurgen, is impossible to
whoever it was that made things as they are, because
he has to look at them, having nothing else
to look at, so how can he be proud? (257). Almost,
having in mind a certain treatise, <cite>De Civitate Dei</cite>,
we can imagine St. Augustine speaking. The things
of this world, the things as they are, are not to
be loved, and he who made them, assuredly not the
real God, finds love foreign to his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<p>Anyhow, this Koshchei, “monstrously pleased”
with Jurgen’s defense of the devils against the
Cistercian monk, puts himself in Jurgen’s way.
Appearing to the hero in the shape of a small
black gentleman, the earth spirit promises Jurgen
a reward (10–11).</p>

<p>What that reward is to be soon develops. Arriving
home, Jurgen finds his wife has vanished.
She has gone to a cave, of evil magic, across Amneran
Heath. On Walpurgis night, that night renowned
in the calendar of demonology, Jurgen
follows her there; but first, at her bidding he must
remove from his neck a cross which had hung
there, the gift of his dead mother (13).</p>

<p>Then comes a medley of classic, of Russian, and
of Norse mythology. Jurgen finds in the cave a
centaur, who gives him a Nessus-shirt (16)—“an
old poet, loaned at once a young man’s body and
the Centaur’s shirt” (131)—the young man’s body
which Faust desired, but the Nessus-shirt which
even Hercules could not wear for long. Jurgen is
now off for his tour of the infinite.</p>

<p>And yet it is not the real Jurgen who makes
this voyage. The real Jurgen, where is he? There
are, in fact, many Jurgens. One of these is a
little boy in Heaven. “That boy”, says God, “is
here with me as you yourself have seen. And
today there is nothing remaining of him anywhere
in the man that is Jurgen” (297). Another Jurgen
is “a young man barely come of age” (23) who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
had loved the young girl Dorothy, and who sees
the Jurgen of today only “as one might see the
face of a dead man drowned in muddy water” (31).
Then there is the Jurgen of today, the Jurgen who
“retains his shop and a fair line of business”, the
Jurgen whose <i lang='la'>confiteor</i> is that Koshchei, the earth
spirit “who made things as they are”, has dealt
with him very justly. “And probably his methods
are everything they should be; certainly I cannot
go so far as to say that they are wrong; but still,
at the same time—” (368). And, separate from
all these Jurgens, the little boy who loved God, the
youth who cherished the normal things of youth,
and the Jurgen of middle age who worships things
as they are, is yet another Jurgen—the Faust-Jurgen,
who, by favor of the powers of darkness, goes
careering on his voyage of the world of fancy, the
world of vision, the world of regrets, the world of
disillusion.</p>

<p>The sequence of his adventures may easily be
traced.</p>

<p>In the first episode Jurgen visits a garden between
dawn and sunrise. It is a garden where
“each man that has ever lived has sojourned for
a little while, with no company save his illusions”
(20). And the spirit of it all is shown forth in
the people whom he first encounters. For they are
a small boy and a girl who forever walk in the
glaze of a mustard jar (19),—forever, that is, like
the youth and the maid on the Grecian urn which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
drew the immortal gaze of Keats. The glance
sweeps forward soon, however, and hence presently
in this garden of memory Jurgen meets the girl
Dorothy, meets her and talks with her (24–33).
When she had gone all was gone and so, when the
sun rose, it was simply “another workday” (34).
The Philistine spirit blew upon the garden, it was
to be remodelled and all the gold was to be rubbed
away (36–7).</p>

<p>Then follows a visit to a character of many
names, but always the same. Jurgen calls her
Sereda, after the manner of Russian mythology,
but she corresponds with the Roman Cybele, the
Goddess of Earth (210, 316) and in the Norse she
is called Æsred (176–7). Goddess of Earth, she
takes the color out of all things. The Fates spin
the glowing threads and weave them into curious
patterns; but when she is done with them there is
no more color, beauty or strangeness apparent
“than in so many dishrags” (40), for she bleaches
where others have colored. Naturally enough she
refers Jurgen back to Koshchei, the spirit who
made things as they are. Once more, through his
intervention, Jurgen meets Dorothy. For in his
attempt to answer life’s riddle, he must perforce
return to the girl whom he had loved while young.
If but they two could be together again in youth,
would not the failures of his life, the disappointments
of the middle years, be but as things that
never had happened? (See 55.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>
<p>While the glamour still holds its spell, to Jurgen
this is the young Dorothy, the girl who has not yet
married; and so, on the moonlit ramp of her father’s
castle they talk of many things as young lovers
would. To them soon comes the girl’s future husband,
but to Jurgen the magic makes it the appearance
simply of a rival suitor; and, the magic
having not yet exhausted its force, the conventional
will have it that, in the words of the old stage directions,
“they fight, and the rival is slain”. Then
the conqueror turns to the lady, but dawn is coming
and the magic is spent. Jurgen finds that this
is not the Dorothy whom he had seen in the garden
between dawn and sunrise (47–60). She is now
repulsive, and he repels her. It is meet and right,
therefore, that the next place to which Jurgen
comes is a cave where are the bodies of many whom
he had formerly known (60–65).</p>

<p>Winding his way through this cave he comes
to Guenevere. She is held by the power of a
giant; and from that giant does Jurgen rescue her
(66–78).</p>

<p>Guenevere, of course, is the lady, charming but
of errant fancy, to whom the chronicles Morte
d’Arthur and Mabinogion were devoted, and of
whose vagaries speak Tennyson’s “Idyls of the
King.” At this time her marriage to Arthur has
been arranged, and Lancelot is coming as his master’s
envoy to arrange the details of the wedding.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
In the end Lancelot captures the heart of Guenevere
(147) but, meanwhile her inclinations have
their way with Jurgen. For Jurgen abides with
her father in the latter’s city of Cameliard, which,
of course, is but another name for Camelot (78–146).
It is, to use the words of our time, a house
party; and, like many house parties, it brings forth
various events. To the guest Jurgen it befalls to
do things ancient and modern, to rescue a princess
from a giant, after the fashion of Sir Thomas
Malory (82–3), to converse with ghosts in a
haunted bed room (145–9) and to carry on with the
fickle Guenevere, whose outstanding trait is “her
innocence, combined with a certain moral obtuseness”
(108). Her worldlywise father learns of the
affair, talks it over with Jurgen, and reminds him
of the duty apparent in the circumstances, that, if
necessary, Jurgen should lie like a gentleman (93).
The matter, however, comes to nothing, for the time
of Guenevere’s marriage to Arthur is at hand. So
she and Jurgen part, she with her mind already
full of Lancelot (147) and Jurgen being taken with
the charms of a new person of the play, of whom
presently. In short, Jurgen leaves Guenevere
where Tennyson takes her up, the stage being thus
cleared for the drama of Lancelot.</p>

<p>Jurgen leaves Cameliard with one who is called
Anaitis (147). But even as Guenevere <span id='TN_1'>typifies</span>
innocence combined with obtuseness (108) Anaitis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
is the personification of a capital sin. Like the
earth goddess Sereda, known also to men as Cybele
and Æsred (of whom <i lang='la'>supra</i>) this Anaitis bears
different names in different places. But always she
is the same. In the Arthurian legend she is the
Lady of the Lake (109), in classic lands she was
Venus, on Eastern soil she was Ashtoreth. She
serves the moon (150), she is the sun’s daughter
(173); and in all lands from Paphos to Babylon do
men rear temples in her honor (341–3). But the
breath of evil nevertheless goes forth from her;
and in her train follows Alecto, whose quality is
retribution (178).</p>

<p>With this Venus, this Anaitis in her land of
Cocaigne, Jurgen lives for a time. But he is not
the only guest of whom legend bears record, not
the only visitor of whom contemporary literature
and art have spoken. Mr.&nbsp;Cabell, however, preserving
that balance of humor which always in this
book is kept level, has given this situation a new
color. Tannhäuser is tempted to return to the
Venusberg; Jurgen leaves Anaitis with never a
glance behind.</p>

<p>But while he stays there, things of black magic
happen. Nor is that strange. Anyone familiar
with the legend embodied in “Tannhäuser” might
expect to find that all things abhorred by Christians
are practiced in the land of Venus, the
Cocaigne of Anaitis.</p>

<p>And so we are able truly to understand the episode,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
occurring while Jurgen abides in this country
of Cocaigne, to which so much attention has been
directed by Mr.&nbsp;Sumner (chap. 22, pp. 151–158).
This Moon Goddess (159) “who ruled not merely
in Cocaigne but furtively swayed the tides of life
everywhere the Moon keeps any power over tides”
(159) had but one mission, “to divert and to turn
aside and deflect” (159). Goethe puts into the
mouth of Mephistopheles the tremendous words, “I
am the spirit that always denies”. The episode in
the present book simply shows forth the action of
the spirit that denies, for to deflect is to deny.
What occurs in the passage to which Mr.&nbsp;Sumner
objects is nothing but a repetition of the mediæval
practice of the Black Mass, the Devil’s Mass. It
is certainly not against the dictates of literature
to publish what the author conceives as a
detail of the mysterious Black Mass; for if so then
the novel, “Black Diamonds”, by the famous Hungarian
novelist of a generation ago, Maurice Jokai,
would never have been allowed in translation. And
that the ceremony in question was a Black Mass
is clear after we read, not merely the words describing
the ceremony itself, but the references to
it that follow.</p>

<p>In the inner sanctuary we find a toad nailed to
a cross (157). The incident occurred “on the eve
of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist” (159), in
other words Midsummer Night’s Eve, at which time,
according to mediæval tradition, the powers of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
darkness are allowed
abroad.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href='#Footnote_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
Let us remember
that in the country of Venus “the Church is not
Christian”, and the law is “do that which seems
good to you” (161). The very goddess herself was
“created by perversity, and everyone knows that it
is the part of piety to worship one’s creator in
fashions acceptable to that creator” (165). That
goddess, whose mission it was to divert, to deny,
naturally enjoyed “the ceremony of God-baiting”
as Jurgen calls it (157). Tannhäuser abode in the
Venusberg, and nobody has dreamed of forbidding
Wagner’s opera based on that. Jurgen lived in
precisely the same place, but simply described
with more cynicism. Really, we have nothing but
“Tannhäuser” as it would have been written by
Heine, if he had happened to take up the German
legend in the spirit of his own cynical wit. Wagner
took it seriously, and Mr.&nbsp;Cabell does not take
it seriously; that is all the difference.</p>

<p>It will probably be advisable at this point to
explain the details of the lance and the veil as
used in this Devil’s Mass. The explanation, fortunately,
can be shortly put. The lance was a real
lance, which the hooded man handed to Jurgen
(153). The veil was also real. It hung before
the <i lang='el'>adytum</i> (Gr. = inner part of a temple) and inside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
this adytum, beyond the veil, was the cross
with a toad nailed upon it (157). The tip of the
lance was red (154) and with it the veil was pierced
that concealed the cross, but upon the cross hung
the disgusting figure of a toad. The whole thing
was, as Jurgen called it on the spot, a piece of “God-baiting”,
a mockery, after the manner of the mediæval
necromancers, of the mystery of the Passion
of the Cross, of the lance that pierced a sacred Side,
of the veil of the Temple that broke with a certain
event which changed all the tides of history.</p>

<p>Taking it by itself this incident is not obscene
or lewd; for mockery of sacred belief does not, as
matter of law, fall into that class. An attack on
religious belief cannot be indictable as an obscenity
under Section 1141 of the Penal Code; if prosecuted,
it must be indicted as a libel (<cite>People</cite> v.
<cite>Eastman</cite>, 188 N. Y. 478). <em>But we will not allow
the defendants, nor Mr.&nbsp;Cabell, the author, to remain
for a moment solely under that protection.
This book puts forth the attack upon the Christian
belief, not to support the attack, but to deride the
attack itself.</em> It is a matter of common observation
that <em>infidelity itself partakes of a religious
fervor, and it is of that fervor that Jurgen makes
fun</em>. “Well, well!” says Jurgen, “but you are a
little old fashioned, with all these equivocal mummeries”
(157). Being “skeptical” (165) he denies
that “death is going to end all for him” (171). And
so Cocaigne “does not satisfy him” (172), he expresses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
his discontent at length (163–170) until
Anaitis, in wrath, calls him “irreverent” (167),
and that leads to their parting.</p>

<p>Surely that is a moral ending! Jurgen leaves
Anaitis, his heart and mind not going along with
the beliefs and practices of a goddess who enjoys
every “far-fetched frolic of heathenry”, and who
goes forth into the world to tempt people like St.
Simeon Stylites and the hermits of the Thebaid
(176). If it is unlawful to say that in print, then
we must suppress Flaubert’s “Temptation of St.
Anthony”, and we should certainly never permit
“Tannhäuser” or “Thais” to be sung at the Metropolitan.</p>

<p>Then what survives all of this? What indeed
but the words of one of the goddess’ friends, the
Master Philologist, who says: “The Jewish mob
spoke louder than He Whom they crucified. But
the Word endures” (182). Jurgen, in short, tires
of this place, a place where “it appears that their
notion of felicity is to dwell eternally in a glorified
brothel” (187).</p>

<p>He is now looking for Helen of Troy. Of course
it is not criminal to think about her, since otherwise
the second part of Faust should not be allowed in
print, nor should Tennyson’s “Dream of Fair
Women”. So it is lawful for Jurgen to look for
her, and he does look. But on his way comes another
episode.</p>

<p>In the domain of Leuke (192) he meets a hamadryad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
named Chloris. Leuke is the land of conventionality
where nobody ever does anything except
what he has been accustomed to do, and would
never dream of doing a thing which nobody ever
heard of doing (203–204). Consequently the wisest
person among them is the god Silenus, the god of
drunkenness, and he is always drunk in order to
escape the conventional (208–9). That of course is
not right, but the indictment is not drawn under
the Volstead Law. Jurgen stops among these people
and marries a little hamadryad, who is all that
a wife should be (215) and who puts up a lunch
for him when he goes for a walk (215). So conventional
is Leuke, be it noted, that even a stroll
is out of keeping. In this country of conventionality
the people have never taken a holiday, nobody
ever having heard of such a thing (206). It is the
Utopia of the Podsnaps of Dickens’ time, of the
Rotarians of our own. But his life in this happy
place, where nothing out of the ordinary ought in
nature’s course to happen, does not last long. War
is threatened by the Philistines.</p>

<p>Be it observed, from what has already been said,
that the Philistines and the people of Leuke were
made by the same creator, the power that made
things as they are, and consequently it does not
much matter who will win, because all it will amount
to is that “dullness will conquer dullness” (209).
Yet in the matter of dullness the balance is with
the Philistines. Fire is their means of sacrifice,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
not because of the glow, but because it ends in
ashes, and the gray of ashes is their favorite color
(230). They are Realists (231) and they believe
that there is no art except it “teach something”
(241). Their high priests claim to have read every
book ever written, and denounce those who doubt
the assertion (244). Knowing everything, believing
in nothing that is not practical, they have a
summary way of dealing with those who presume
to disagree. All such recalcitrants are sent to Hell,
“relegated to Limbo” (242).</p>

<p>Against the people of Leuke, the ordinary conventionalists,
came these Philistines, the militant
Realists. Naturally the Philistines conquered, and
the people of Leuke were condemned to death.
Jurgen’s wife, the little hamadryad whose life was
bound up with that of her tutelary tree (215)
perished with its felling. The Philistine Queen
took a fancy to Jurgen, but he, “coming of morbid
ancestry” (247) declined to abide in Philistia; and
so they sent him to the limbo which they call Hell
(250).</p>

<p>A better fate befalls the allied city of Pseudopolis.
There live those of the Grecian spirit, of
that spirit of Hellenism which, according to
Matthew Arnold, wars always with the genius of
Philistia. There abides Helen of Troy. Her Jurgen
sees (224–9) the occasion being much the same as
that which is pictured in Keats’ “St. Agnes Eve”.
These people the Philistines could not slay, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
“when the Philistines shouted in their triumph,
Achilles and all they who served him rose from
the ground like gleaming clouds and passed above
the heads of the Philistines, deriding them” (231).
But Jurgen and the people of ordinary conventionality
perished, and thus our next view of Jurgen
finds him in Hell.</p>

<p>The Hell to which he has gone is the Hell of his
forefathers, being in truth but a monument to
their egotism. They built it “out of the pride which
led them to believe that what they did was of sufficient
importance to merit punishment” (253).
There Jurgen sees his father standing calmly in
the midst of an especially tall flame, and very well
satisfied with it, because of his confidence that he
is important enough to deserve a special place in
Hell. Therefore he is angry when the attendant
devil does not sufficiently tend his furnace (254,
260–7).</p>

<p>It is not obscene, at least at common law, to speak
lightly of Hell. If it were otherwise a great many
books would be condemned. Every lawyer knows
what was said about Lord Hatherley, when he,
sitting in the Privy Council, held that the calvinistic
idea of Hell was not part of the religion of
the Church of England. It was said that Lord
Hatherley had dismissed Hell with costs and had
deprived thousands of their hope of everlasting
damnation. Nor is it obscene to represent that
there are people whose sense of personal importance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
rules even in death, people who think that their
sins are greater than the sins of anybody else, not
because of their quality as sins but because of the
persons who commit them. And, pausing yet
further at this point, let us suggest that if it is
lewd to make fun of Philistia, then all of Matthew
Arnold’s books should be burned by the hangman;
and certainly Whistler’s book, “The Gentle Art
of Making Enemies”, <span id='TN_2'>should never have been
allowed</span> in public print. Indeed it was Arnold, the
father-in-law of a late most respectable member of
this Bar, who invented the term Philistines as
used in the present connection. Mr.&nbsp;Cabell has
simply put in another form the protest that can be
made against this point of view. At least it is open
to protest.</p>

<p>Of course, we may not be able to agree with all
of Mr.&nbsp;Cabell’s classifications as to what pertains to
Philistia. Many of us are citizens of that country
without knowing it. But it is not obscene or lewd
for some one else to call us Philistines because of
the views we may happen to hold dear. Legally we
cannot object; practically we conserve our energies
by not doing so. Like the famous Bishop Bonner
of Queen Mary’s time, we may do well to laugh
at the caricatures which the heretics make of us.</p>

<p>With this in mind we might get enjoyment out
of Jurgen’s observations as to the real issue between
Heaven and Hell. The war between them is not
as Milton saw it. Rather, the war is between autocracy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
and democracy; and Hell is fighting to make
the universe safe for democracy (287). Everybody
knew how Satan came to be the chief magistrate of
Hell, he was elected to that office, and he has continued
in office so long simply because elections
are inadvisable in war time (278–9). And while
Hell used vigorous methods against dissenters, that
was only because of necessary war time legislation
(278–9). But Heaven was indisputably an autocracy,
because nobody knew how God derived his
power. He had been there through the ages, and
He proposed to have no successor (286). Such,
then, was the issue. Of its outcome, the shrewd
Jurgen was inclined to favor Heaven, because of
its superior military efficiency (287). And so,
although Jurgen’s friends in Hell try to dissuade
him (288), although he has married in Hell a vampire
who is quite conventional, and life there is conventional
also—“Hurry”, says his wife, “for we are
spending the evening with the Asmodeuses” (277)—Jurgen
leaves Hell and visits Heaven.</p>

<p>At that moment the mood of the author changes.
Jurgen ascends to Heaven leaving irreverence behind,
and the pictures now uncovered are of different
tone and motive. The first person whom he sees
is a little boy who was once Jurgen himself. When
Jurgen meets God he says, “Once very long ago I had
faith in you”; to which the reply is, “No, for that
boy is here with me as you yourself have seen, and
today there is nothing remaining of him anywhere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
in the man that is Jurgen”
(297).<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href='#Footnote_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a>
Heaven contains
children, mothers and grandmothers. Logic
cannot lead one to it, because logic does not exist
there. Therefore, children, mothers and grandmothers
can ascend to Heaven where people like
Jurgen cannot. Taking Heaven as an illusion, Jurgen
finds none of his own illusions there, and hence
he must “return to such illusions as are congenial,
for one must believe in something” (306). And yet
he has stood motionless for thirty-seven days in that
place, “forgetful of everything save that the God
of his grandmother was love” (306–7). Nobody
else, he is told, has willingly turned away so soon,
and it is supposed that this is due to some evil
wrought in the Nessus shirt he was wearing, the
like of which was never seen in Heaven (307). And
finally this wayfarer, this man of modern philosophy,
says that he turned away from Heaven because
he seeks for justice and he cannot find it in the eyes
of God, “but only love and such forgiveness as
troubled him” (307). To which archangels reply
that because of that very fact he should rejoice
(307).</p>

<p>If that is obscene, then “The Little Flowers” of
St. Francis D’Assisi should at once be suppressed
by Mr.&nbsp;Sumner. If it is lewd to teach that none
of us would go to Heaven if we had justice done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
us, Christianity once more should betake itself to
the catacombs.</p>

<p>We are let down from these heights by way of
an interview between Jurgen and St. Peter. The
Saint has something to say about prohibition (311–313)
with which, theoretically speaking, many
might disagree. But as the defendants are not indicted
under the prohibition laws, it is needless
to go into this discussion. The Saint also represents
Heaven as pacifistic (312–313); but Mr.&nbsp;Cabell
wrote after the Armistice, and pacifism is not,
legally speaking, obscene or lewd, whatever else it
undoubtedly is.</p>

<p>The travels of Jurgen now draw near to their
end, the rest of the book simply rounding out the
ideas suggested. Returning to earth, he meets once
more the earth goddess Sereda, and the pith of their
talk is the conclusion, not that “there is no meaning
in anything”,—that, both agree, nobody really could
face,—but that the lower god, Koshchei, who made
things as they are, “is in turn the butt of some
larger jest, * * * that all of us take part in a
moving and a shifting and a reasoned use of things
* * * a using such as we do not comprehend and
are not fit to comprehend” (317). The quest of
Jurgen ends, fitly enough, with a return to this
lower power (329), this power that made things
as they are, but is controlled, however rebellious,
by a higher force beyond him (333).</p>

<p>We then have a return, in pageant form, of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
women with whom, in this year of pilgrimage just
ended (319), Jurgen has foregathered. First there
is Guenevere (335) who is now ready to be his wife,
Arthur being gone into Avalon and Lancelot being
turned monk (335); Anaitis follows (340), then
Helen of Troy (345). But all of them he refuses.
“For I am transmuted by time’s handling. I have
become the lackey of prudence and half measures”
(348). Then appears to him his wife (350) who
disposes of Koshchei “casually, for she believed
him to be merely Satan” (353). After ordering
Jurgen to be sure to be home in time for supper
and to stop on the way to get a half pound of butter,
she passes out “neither as flame nor mist, but
as the voice of judgment” (355). Jurgen follows
her (356), but on the way he sees Dorothy, Dorothy
as she is and not as she had lived in either
memory or imagination (364). He arrives home
recollecting that he had forgotten to do the errand
his wife told him to perform, but reflecting that
after all things were just about as well with him
as could be. He has his wife, he has his business,
and the god of things as they are has probably
dealt with him very justly. “And probably his
methods are everything they should be; certainly
I cannot go so far as to say that they are wrong;
but still at the same time—Then Jurgen sighed
and entered his snug home” (368).</p>

<p>Doubtless we have erred in many ways in our
interpretation of the book under attack: we are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
quite sure that we have not done it justice. After
all, it must speak for itself, for everyone has his
own reading of whatsoever comes to his notice.
But of one thing we are sure, that it fills the test of
literature as distinct from pornography; that it
has a theme, sustains a thought, criticises life. <em>It
attempts, among other things, to show the futility
of escaping from conventionality by way of seeking
sin, for sin itself has its conventions. It pictures
sin in this spirit, and in doing so it perforce speaks
of sin.</em> But it must be judged as a whole, not by a
sentence here, or even by a page there (<cite>Halsey</cite> v.
<cite>N. Y. Society</cite>, 234 N. Y. 1). And, as decided in the
case just cited, a publication can be lawful even if it
should happen to contain indecent passages.</p>

is nothing in “Jurgen” which is indecent. A man
studiously on the alert for the indecent can put his
finger on certain words in the book; but the very
meaning of these words is decent if we will but read
them in the connection to which they are meant to
refer. And other things that are said, so far from
being indecent, are things lawfully to be said, unless
the body of our literature should perish from
the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>
<p>All of this is illustrated by the bill of particulars
which Mr.&nbsp;Sumner, one of the prosecutors in this
case, furnished when he filed a complaint in the
Special Sessions. Mr.&nbsp;Sumner there enumerates
the pages containing, as he thinks, lewd and
obscene matter. We shall now deal with the particulars
thus furnished.</p>

<p>What is there to complain of on pages 59, 88, 99,
114, 134–5, 275? Pages 88 and 99 require no discussion.
On pages 134–5 Guenevere takes leave of
Jurgen, that is all. On page 59 occurs “temptress”,
which is not obscene. On page 114 the ghost of
Smoit tells Jurgen that he is his grandfather, instead
of the putative ancestor whom Jurgen had
always accepted. But if this is lewd, then we must
stop the sale of such books as Thackeray’s “Henry
Esmond”. On page 275 Jurgen stops his vampire
wife from sucking his blood through biting his
chest. Burne-Jones’ painting “The Vampire”, is
familiar,—even to those of us who never frequent
galleries at home or abroad,—through Kipling’s
famous poem.</p>

<p>But as perhaps it is not suitable thus to summarize
the particulars which Mr.&nbsp;Sumner was at
such pains to gather, we will take the other pages
which he mentions and deal with them <i lang='la'>seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>Pages 57–8—Jurgen’s conversation with Dorothy
in the garden. A kiss is not indecent. Temptation
came, but it was dispelled.</p>

<p>Page 61—Reference to “the bed” is made—But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
for whom? The bride. A bridal bed is not obscene
or lewd. <i lang='la'>Vide</i> wedding march in “Lohengrin”, and
the relative chapters in Scott’s “The Bride of
Lammermuir”.</p>

<p>Page 63—“Had wondered if he were really the
first man for whom she had put a deceit upon her
husband”, etc. If this is obscene, then nearly all
current fiction is, to say nothing of the classics,
ancient or modern.</p>

<p>Page 64—Jurgen counts up his conquests. But
so did Don Juan. “The end of all is death”—but so
said Villon—“<i lang='fr'>Ou sont les nieges d’antan?</i>”</p>

<p>Page 67—Speaks simply of a kiss. Whether long
or short, a kiss is not lewd.</p>

<p>Page 80—Jurgen is talking about Guenevere to
her father—“I can get justice done me anywhere,
in all the bed chambers of the world.” If this is
lewd, then we should abolish Ophelia’s mad song
in Hamlet. Anyhow, Jurgen goes on to say (same
page) “I only meant in a manner of speaking, sir.”</p>

<p>Pages 84–6—Jurgen tells Yolande she must reward
him by candle light, etc. This contains no
description of any offensive act. There is nothing
explicit.</p>

<p>Page 89—Guenevere’s father suspects that she
was not entirely chaste while in the giant’s cavern.
Has literature, ancient or modern, never previously
exposed a father’s doubt of his daughter’s chastity?
Did no one ever study the Greek tragedies?</p>

<p>Page 90—The King wonders whether “a thing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
like this is happening” in his city in many places,
and Jurgen says that it probably is. Sinclair Lewis
has similar speculations in “Babbitt”. The references
to a “breakage” refer to infractions of moral
law.</p>

<p>Page 92—The King says that, if Jurgen has had
improper relations with Guenevere, he should lie
like a gentleman. Where is the obscenity? Has not
that phrase become time-worn, in literature and
conversation, since the late eighties?</p>

<p>Page 98—Jurgen looks forward “to more intimate
converse” with the lady. Entirely compatible
with just what it says. The dreadful word “liaison”
also is used. But the late war has brought it
into such use—“liaison officer”; “liaison between
the Y. M. C. A. and the chaplains’ corps”, etc.—that
the word now has <em>Anglice</em> the extensive meaning
that the French always allowed it.</p>

<p>Pages 100, 102, 104–8—These deal with Jurgen’s
affair with Guenevere. If read as a whole, bearing
in mind the outstanding point, that Guenevere’s
characteristic was “her innocence, combined with a
certain moral obtuseness” (108) there is nothing
lewd or obscene in this any more than in Hardy’s
“Tess of the D’Urbervilles”. Reference may be made
to page 102, where Jurgen had his answer to the
question, what sort of service did women most cordially
appreciate. He believed they did not really
desire to be served as (103) a symbol of Heaven’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
perfection, as (336) half goddess, half bric-a-brac.
But this opinion was not suitable for a mixed audience
in Glathion, where people believed otherwise
(104–108). They are not said to have done anything
but kiss and talk. The reasons for their
talking in privacy are logical. If any improprieties
took place the text nowhere alludes to them. Compare
the first part of Goethe’s “Faust,” Scott’s
“The Heart of Midlothian,” George Eliot’s “Adam
Bede” and “Middlemarch,” or Stevenson’s “Weir
of Hermiston,” for precisely similar seductions.</p>

<p>Page 120—Jurgen gets into the bedroom of the
Bishop. “His eminence was not alone, but as both
occupants of the <em>apartment</em> were asleep, Jurgen
saw nothing unepiscopal”.—If we are to be literal,
then let us observe that this passage does not say
(<i>a</i>) that the other was a female; (<i>b</i>) that they
were in bed together. Sterne’s “Sentimental Journey”
has passages much more explicit.</p>

<p>Page 144—Jurgen talks concerning Guenevere
and Lancelot. Tennyson, in verse, discoursed of
the same thing.</p>

<p>Pages 161–8—Deal with Jurgen’s matrimonial
quarrels with Anaitis, who, for all she is a nature
myth and believes in symbolism, is quarrelsome.
She does not like Jurgen to “talk so flippantly
about her religion” (165) and regrets his dislike
of his “in-laws”, such as Apis, the well-known
Egyptian god, who “will go about in public wearing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
a bull’s head”. What is lewd or obscene here?
Surely not the terms “sacti-sodhana” and “muntrus”.
They may look obscene because they are in
an unfamiliar language, but in that language, Sanscrit,
counsel are informed, they refer to religious
rites of the Brahmins, who are not commonly rated
as lewd.</p>

<p>Pages 170–1—Shows that nature myths last only
as long as the philologists let them, hence they are
Epicureans. But Jurgen, being a doubter, is not
sure that death ends all. Is there anything Lewd
or obscene in this quaint turning of the tables on
the materialists?</p>

<p>Pages 174–7—Continues the matrimonial life of
Jurgen and Anaitis, ending with the conviction,
forced on him, that the ruling spirit of this land
of hers is nothing else but Cybele, the Roman goddess
of earth, or Æsred, or Sereda, as she is variously
called. And so he became convinced “that
all such employment was a peculiarly unimaginative
pursuit of happiness” (177). Surely a good
moral lesson, if anything.</p>

<p>Page 186—Simply a symbolic way of telling us
that “Time begets nothing”. He sleeps in Atlantis,
while Briareus watches. Life is a ceaseless round,
history is a ceaseless round, of old things. It is
a commonplace of Greek mythology that Chronos,
[Time] was mutilated by his son Zeus.</p>

<p>Pages 186, 321, 154—Carry reference to the fact
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
that there are such things as eunuchs. If it is
wrong to refer to eunuchs, then most literature, not
only of the East, but referring to it, should be
expunged. St. Philip’s first convert was an eunuch
(Acts VIII, 26–40). In “Innocents Abroad” Mark
Twain gives the story of the revenge which Heloise’s
uncle caused to be taken upon Abelard.</p>

<p>Page 211—Refers to the priests of Cybele. If they
were eunuchs, that would not be, as said above,
an obscene fact. But they were not eunuchs, as it
happened. The priests of Cybele were madmen:
that is, they had been deprived of their wits, and
had thus “parted with possessions which Jurgen
valued”. Above all things the practical-minded
Jurgen valued sanity. See Tooke’s “Pantheon,”
p. 172: “The Priests of Cybele were named Galli,
from a river of Phrygia. Such was the nature of
the water of this river, that whoever drank of it
immediately grew mad. The Galli, as often as
they sacrificed, furiously cut and slashed their
arms with knives; and thence all furious and mad
people were called Galantes.”</p>

<p>Pages 196–200, 203, 206–7, 124–8, 148–150—<em>References
to objects</em>:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Jurgen’s staff (196–200, 203). The answer
to this, like the answer to the insinuations about
the lance in chapter 22 (<i lang='la'>vide supra</i>) is that it was
a staff, and nothing else (see p. 95).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Harpocrates, “who held an astonishing object”
(206–7). This is attacked along with the
reference to the People of the Fields, who practise
eudæmonism. Jurgen sees the People of the Fields,
“who dwell between the forest and the <span id='TN_3'>city of Pseudopolis”</span>
(204). These people “did one and all what
they had always done” (204) whereas, “whoever
heard of the People of the Wood doing anything
useful?” So Jurgen, after being informed that the
People of the Field never take a holiday (206) decides
to see what the People of the Wood do about it
(206). He finds them practicing eudæmonism outdoors
instead of indoors. Eudæmonism: “The type
of utilitarian ethical theory that makes the pursuit,
enjoyment and production of happiness the supreme
end in moral conduct.”—Funk &amp; Wagnalls’ Dictionary.
This was of course the creed of Cocaigne—“Eat,
drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.”
The point here is that satyrs do not go indoors, for
the reason that for a satyr to go indoors is unheard
of. If it is indecent to mention a satyr, then not
only should Keats and Swinburne be destroyed, but
Elizabeth Barrett Browning should be reprimanded
for writing that poem “A Musical Instrument”,
which is all about “The Great God Pan”, chief of
Satyrs. As to Harpocrates, we refer to Tooke’s
“Pantheon of the Heathen Gods”,—a most respectable
authority. It is there said (p. 352): “The
Egyptians worshipped Harpocrates as the god of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Silence * * * They consecrated the tree persea
to him; because the fruit was like a heart * * *
He was painted with a finger upon his lips, thereby
commanding silence.” It is, therefore, probably
the persea fruit which Harpocrates is carrying,
and the astonishment of Jurgen at seeing the human
heart thus publicly displayed is equally nature
and good allegory. The custom that led to stiffness
was of course Harpocrates’ custom of not
speaking to or answering the remarks of
others.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Jurgen’s sword (124–8, 148–150). Mention
is made of Jurgen’s sword. But, like the staff and
the lance (<i lang='la'>vide supra</i>) all that need be said is that
it really is a sword, Caliburn. The book tells just
where and how he got it (72, 76).</p>

<p><span id='TN_4'>(<i>d</i>)</span> The doorknocker on the entrance to Cocaigne
(150). These were simply the nude figures of Adam
and Eve. Jurgen, being conventional, and yet seeking
sin, is embarrassed at the nude, and thinks it
is indecent; so he talks about it.</p>

<p>Pages 196–200, 203—Jurgen’s meeting, and marriage,
with Chloris, the Hamadryad. There is
nothing in this does not bear comparison with the
“Endymion” of Keats, or the Chorus from Swinburne’s
“Atalanta in Calydon”. As to the marriage,
see two books in common publication:—Flaubert’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
“Temptation of St. Anthony,” Modern Library,
p. 226: “These are the deities of marriage. They
await the coming of the bride. Domiduca should
lead her in,—Virgo unfasten her girdle,—Subigo
place her in the bed,—and Praema open her arms,
and whisper sweet words into her ear.” Tooke’s
“Pantheon of the Heathen Gods, Adapted for the
Use of Students of Every Age and of Either Sex,”
p. 281: “Jugatinus joined the man and the woman
together in the yoke of matrimony. Domiducus
guided the bride into the bridegroom’s house * * *
Priapus, or Mutinus was also reckoned one of the
nuptial gods, because in his lap the bride was commanded
to sit.”</p>

<p>Pages 271–2, 286—The marriage with the vampire
goes no further than passages in Sterne’s
Sentimental Journey and the novels of Fielding.
The conversation of the vampire leaves things
unsaid rather than said. There is no reason
for taking in a wrong sense the reference to the
sceptre.</p>

<p>Pages 236–9, 241–2. Jurgen’s conversation with
the Queen of Philistia is nothing but a take-off on
the mediæval—occasionally modern—belief in the
magic of numbers. See Baring-Gould’s “Curious
Myths of the Middle Ages,” Appendix E, p. 651:
“Pythagoras taught that each number had its own
peculiar character, virtue and properties. The unit,
or the monad, he says, is the principle and the end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
of all; it is this sublime knot which binds together
the chain of causes; it is the symbol of identity, of
existence, of conservation, and of general harmony
* * * The number <span class='smcap'>Two</span>, or the dyad, the origin
of contrasts, is the symbol of diversity, or inequality,
of division, and of separation. <span class='smcap'>Two</span> is accordingly
an evil principle, characterizing disorder and
confusion * * * <span class="smcap">Three</span>, or the triad, is the number
containing the most sublime mysteries, for
everything is composed of three substances * * *
<span class="smcap">Nine</span>, or the ennead, being the multiple of <span class="smcap">Three</span>,
should be regarded as sacred. Finally, <span class="smcap">Ten</span>, or the
decad, is the measure of all, since it contains all
the numeric relations and harmonies.” “Eight (p.
652) is the number of the Beatitudes.”</p>

<p>Pages 340–3—contain nothing but a statement
of the fact that Venus, as a cult, has her followers
and her temples,—nothing that poets of times past
have not told us again and again. The temples
existed, and are mentioned freely in all books of
classical mythology.</p>

<p>We are almost at the end of Mr.&nbsp;Sumner’s particulars;
but there are two that deserve notice.</p>

<p>He finds obscenity on pages 228–9. There we
find Jurgen standing at the bed of the sleeping
Helen, but leaving her untouched, because he wants
to retain his “unreasonable dreams”. If this is
obscenity, then indeed Keats wrote in lewdest mood
the “Eve of St. Agnes”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>
<p>And Mr.&nbsp;Sumner finds obscenity on page 142.
What do we find there? We find Jurgen kneeling
before a crucifix!</p>

<p>And there let us leave the case.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ch_7">7—In conclusion.</h2>
</div>

<p>No book, no matter by whom it is written, should
be read without an appreciation of the motive of
its writing. It is the embarrassment of a case
such as this, that the very fact of an indictment,
the notoriety attending it, makes it difficult to sit
down to the reading with the frame of mind that is
present when we take a book from a library shelf.
However one may attempt to resist it, there is
always present a certain feeling, if somebody has
said that the book is indecent. That suggestion
can influence minds, even the most philosophical.
In Lord Haldane’s most recent book, “The
Philosophy of Humanism” (p. 75), he quotes from
the memoirs of the great German philosopher,
Hegel, as illustrating how suggestion can lead to
conceptions:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In my youth I remember hearing a city
magistrate complain that book writers were
going too far, and trying to rout out Christianity
altogether. Some one, it appeared, had
written a defense of suicide. It was horrible,
too horrible! On further inquiry it turned out
that the book in question was ‘The Sorrows
of Werther’.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>
<p>The last resort against this influence of suggestion
is now made. The book is submitted to this
court for judicial scrutiny, guided by the tests of
the law.</p>

<p>The defendants herein, at the close of the People’s
case, have moved for a direction of acquittal
and the dismissal of the indictment on the ground
that the book “Jurgen” on the possession of which
the indictment is based, is not an “obscene, lewd,
lascivious, filthy, indecent or disgusting book”
within the meaning and intent of section 1141 of
the Penal Law, for the alleged violation of which
the indictment has been found.</p>

<p>I have read and examined the book carefully.
It is by Mr.&nbsp;James Branch Cabell, an author of
repute and distinction. From the literary point
of view its style may fairly be called brilliant.
It is based on the mediæval legends of Jurgen
and is a highly imaginative and fantastic tale,
depicting the adventures of one who has been restored
to his first youth but who, being attended
by a shadow in the guise of the shadow of his old
self, retains the experience and cynicism of age
which frustrates a perfect fulfillment of his desire
for renewed youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>
<p>The adventures consist in wanderings through
mediæval and mythological countries and a sojourn
in Hell and Heaven. He encounters beings
of mediæval folk-lore and from classical Mythology.
The most that can be said against the book
is that certain passages therein may be considered
suggestive in a veiled and subtle way of
immorality, but such suggestions are delicately
conveyed and the whole atmosphere of the story
is of such an unreal and supernatural nature that
even these suggestions are free from the evils accompanying
suggestiveness in more realistic
works. In fact, it is doubtful if the book could be
read or understood at all by more than a very
limited number of readers.</p>

<p>In my opinion the book is one of unusual literary
merit and contains nothing “obscene, lewd,
lascivious, filthy, indecent or disgusting” within
the meaning of the statute and the decisions of
the courts of this state in similar cases. (See
Halsey v. New York Society, 234 N. Y. 1; People
v. Brainard, 192 App. Div. 116; St. Hubert Guild
v. Quinn, 64 Misc. 336.)</p>

<p>The motion, therefore, is granted and the jury
is advised to acquit the defendants.</p>

“James Branch Cabell is making a clean getaway with <cite>Jurgen</cite>,
quite the naughtiest book since George Moore began ogling maidservants
in Mayo. How come? Dreiser had the law hot after him for <cite>The
Genius</cite> and <cite>Hager Revelly</cite> came close to landing Daniel Carson
Goodman in Leavenworth, yet these volumes are innocent compared with
<cite>Jurgen</cite>, which deftly and knowingly treats in thinly veiled
episodes of all the perversities, abnormalities and damn-foolishness
of sex. There is an undercurrent of extreme sensuality throughout the
book, and once the trick of transposing the key is mastered one can dip
into this tepid stream on every page. Cabell has cleansed his bosom
of much perilous stuff—a little too much, in fact, for <cite>Jurgen</cite>
grows tiresome toward the end—but he has said everything about the
mechanics of passion and said it prettily. He has a gift of dulcet
English prose, but I like better the men who say things straight out
and use gruff Anglo-Saxon monosyllables for the big facts of nature
that we are supposed to ignore.</p>

<p class='no-indent'>“It is curious how the non-reading public discovered <cite>Jurgen</cite>.
A few days after it appeared on the newsstands a male vampire of the

Broadway: ‘Say, kid, get a book called <cite>Jurgen</cite>. It gets away with

particularly upon pages 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 63, 64, 67, 80, 84, 86,
89, 92, 93, 98, 99, 100, 102, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 114, 120, 124,

<p>THE GRAND JURY OF THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK by this indictment, accuse

and for a considerable time prior thereto, with intent to sell and

<ul>
<li>The prologue has numbered footnotes and the body text
used footnotes marked with asterisks.  Continued the numbered footnotes
through the body text. Moved the footnotes to the end of the text.</li>

<li> Changed three instances of “mediaeval” to “mediæval”
which was used in four other instances.</li>

<li>Changed three instances of "to-day" to "today", which was used more frequently in
both plain and quoted texts.</li>

<li> The author uses "<cite>St. Hubert’s Guild</cite> v. <cite>Quinn</cite> (64 Misc. 336)"
both with and without the possessive on "Hubert."  These inconsistencies left as
in the original.</li>

<li><a href='#TN_1'>p. 43</a> Corrected "typefies" to "typifies".</li>

<li><a href='#TN_2'>p. 52</a> Removed duplicate “have” from “should never have have been allowed”.</li>

<li><a href='#TN_3'>p. 64</a> Added missing end quote after “city of Pseudopolis”.</li>

<li><a href='#TN_4'>p. 65</a>  Section (d) in the original was originally labelled as
  section (e) and there was no section (d).</li>

<li><a href='#TN_5'>p. 78</a> In the New York state code, the paragraph starting with "3."
  ends with a comma.  Corrected this to be consistent with other
    numbered paragraphs.</li>
